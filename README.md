Installation
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-book-blog.git
cd my-book-blog
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install the required dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set up PostgreSQL
1.	Install PostgreSQL on your machine.
2.	Create a new database in PostgreSQL, for example:
sql
CREATE DATABASE book_blog;
3.	Update the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI in app.py with your PostgreSQL credentials:
python
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://your_username:your_password@localhost:5432/book_blog'
5. Initialize the Database
Run the following command to create the necessary database tables:
bash
python app.py
This will create the post table in your PostgreSQL database. You can also use Flask Migrations for managing database schema changes, but this is not required for the basic setup.
6. Run the Application
Start the Flask development server:
bash
python app.py
This will run the application locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
